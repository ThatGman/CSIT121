    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>Gaymer's Guild is a club created to promote equity, inclusion, and diversity in the technology, gaming, and LGBTQ+ communities at CCBC Essex. Our aim is to create a safe space for students of any background to come together and be able to talk about queer culture and its representation in gaming. We plan to have many events not exclusive to gaming, though. Stay tuned if you're interested!</p>
