    <h1>Enduring Wild Fried Greens</h1>
    <h2><i>An adventurer's best source of energy and nutrition!</i></h2>

    <h3>Ingredients and Utensils Needed:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Hyrule Herbs: Typically found all throughout Hyrule (given the name).</li>
        <li>Endura Carrots: Found near sacred grounds such as the Great Fairy Fountains.</li>
        <li>Meat: The meat can be of varying quality; the higher quality the meat, the more revitalized you will be left feeling upon consumption.</li>
        <li>Pot: The people of Hyrule are fairly friendly during these trying times and allow many folks to use their pots as they see fit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the meat you have into slices, allowing them to be placed into the pot easier.</li>
        <li>Place the sliced up meat into the pot, allowing them to simmer.</li>
        <li>Dice the Endura Carrots and Hyrule Herbs.</li>
        <li>Upon dicing the carrots and herbs, allow the meat to simmer until brown.</li>
        <li>Remove meat from pot once it is brown.</li>
        <li>Season the meat with the herbs and carrots and let it sit overnight to absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Upon waking up the next morning, the food should be ready for you to safely eat during your adventure. Be wary of bokoblins, as they may be more attracted to you due to the scent of the food.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Why this is My Favorite Recipe</h3>
    <p>This is my favorite recipe because it helps me quite a lot in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. The recipe I gave of meat, herbs, and an endura carrot is just one way that you can make really powerful food but there is a much greater variety of foods available on <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Tears_of_the_Kingdom#Food">the Zelda Wiki.</a></p>
